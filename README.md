- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Dethorasis
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Javascript and plan to use GitHub as a space to put all of my learnings and place to build projects.
- ğŸŒ± So far I only have very minor basic exercises and concepts to put on here and much of the exercises come from Jonas Schmedtmans course on JS.

- ğŸ‘‹ Unfortunately I've only had time to display some very basic concepts, however this will be updated in the coming days.
